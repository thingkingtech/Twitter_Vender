King Price Twitter Vending Machine

Call to Action: Tweet @KingPriceIns with #VendKing, Product desired and Emoji code displayed on machine.

2 Emojis are displayed as "Secret Code"

User tweets with mention and hashtag and secret code, with product they desire in the vending machine. 
The system checks if the mention, hashtag and emojis tweeted are correct, and if the user hasn't used the system within the last 6 months. 
If these checks are passed, the system passes the responding keypad entries to the vending machine's keypad and the desired product is vended. A tweet is then sent to the user thanking them.
If a check is not passed, the system tweets the user with the error (ie. Incorrect Emoji Code)
